# Simple Command-Line Calculator

This repository contains a straightforward, single-run command-line calculator program written in Python. It's designed as a beginner-friendly project to demonstrate fundamental arithmetic operations and basic user interaction in a console environment.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Addition (`+`):** Adds two numbers.
* **Subtraction (`-`):** Subtracts the second number from the first.
* **Multiplication (`*`):** Multiplies two numbers.
* **Division (`/`):** Divides the first number by the second, with basic error handling for division by zero.
* **User-Friendly:** Prompts the user for inputs and operation choice.

## üöÄ How to Use

To run this calculator, you'll need Python installed on your computer.

### Prerequisites

* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Download and install the latest Python 3 version if you don't have it.)

### Running the Calculator

1.  **Save the code:**
    * Save the calculator code (from our conversation) into a file named `my_calculator.py`. Make sure it's in a folder you can easily find (e.g., your Desktop or a dedicated `github_projects` folder).

2.  **Open your Command Prompt/Terminal:**
    * **On Windows:** Open File Explorer, go to the folder where you saved `my_calculator.py`. Click in the address bar at the top, type `cmd`, and press `Enter`. This will open Command Prompt directly in that folder.
    * **On Mac/Linux:** Open your Terminal application and use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you saved the file. For example: `cd ~/Desktop` or `cd /path/to/your/folder`.

3.  **Run the Python script:**
    * Once you are in the correct folder in your Command Prompt/Terminal, type the following command and press `Enter`:
        ```bash
        python my_calculator.py
        ```

4.  **Interact with the calculator:**
    * Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your numbers and choose an operation.
    * The calculator will perform the calculation and display the result, then the program will exit.
